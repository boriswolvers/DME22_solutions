# Overview
Looking at @fig-scatter, we can see that the setosa and versicolor can overlap in terms of sepal length.

However, for a given sepal length, setosa will typically have wider leaves.

# Linear model

If we use a linear regression model, we can see that the 98% confidence in @fig-linear strongly suggests
that the setosa grows much faster in width than the other two species.

# Boxplot

If we divide the width by the length for every leave, this is confirmed again by the histogram in @fig-hist
Setosa will, on average, gain 0.7 width units for every unit in length it grows, while both versicolor and virginica grow about 0.4-0.5.
